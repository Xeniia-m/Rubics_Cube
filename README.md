 'U' press state for up wall rotation animation (90 degrees clockwise).
 'D' press state for down wall rotation animation (90 degrees clockwise).
 'B' press state for back wall rotation animation (90 degrees clockwise).
 'F' press state for front wall rotation animation (90 degrees clockwise).
 ' ' press state for flipping rotation direction (from clockwise to counter clockwise
or vise versa).
 'Z' press state for faster rotation animation.
 'A' press state for slower rotation animation.

  Mouse:
- Moving while holding left button will rotate the cube
- Moving while holding right button will move the camera up, down, left or right.
- Scroll up and down will move the camera along Z axis (back and forward).
